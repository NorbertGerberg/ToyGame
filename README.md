<h1>About</h1>

ToyGame can be seen as a streamlined version of NGE2.

It serves as a foundational framework, encompassing essential functionalities such as window creation,
input handling for keyboard, mouse, and gamepad, rendering, and audio playback.

Borrowing code directly from NGE2, it provides a user-friendly starting point for
graphical applications, particularly video games.

ToyGame leverages Branimir Karadzic's bgfx library for rendering,
supporting both DirectX11/12 and Vulkan. Additionally, it utilizes Jari Komppa's SoLoud
for audio processing and GLFW3 for window management.
